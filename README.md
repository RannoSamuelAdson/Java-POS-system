# Java-POS-system
This is a Java POS system. It grants full access to a warehouse and purchase system. Additionally, it saves the history of all made sales in a hsql database. 
This application has both CLI and GUI support with a set of unit tests for both of them. 

To run it, open the project and select the Gradle tool window. Then run "Tasks/other/hsql"(and give a moment for the database to start up). 
Then run "SalesSystemCLI/Tasks/application/run" or "SalesSystemGUI/Tasks/application/run" for access to the interface.
